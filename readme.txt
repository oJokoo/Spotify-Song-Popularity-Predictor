Files Included:
		ProjectSlides - Contains the slideset for my project
	
		ProjectReport - Contains my project report

		Project.ipynb - Contains the code for my project
	
		readme - This document
How to run:

	Open the .pynb file, if it opens up in an editor be sure to run the boxes 1 by 1.
	
	Otherwise, can open the file in a text editor and paste whereever desired.

NOTE:

	There is two run throughs in the .ipynb file. 
	
	Run 1) - Models were trying to predict the track_popularity

	Run 2) - Models were trying to predict 'Target' which was either 0 or 1

Debugging:
	
	Ensure that all libraries are installed (use pip install)
	
	If the program is taking too long to compute, lower then training and test data split.
		Currently it is at .8, .2
